            <p1>This website stores quotes from <em>The Office</em> that I find funny, important, or memorable in some way.<br></br>
                The site was built using Vite + ReactJS.<br></br>
                This project is not finished (as evidenced by this About page), but I will continue to sharpen my skills and make improvements!
            </p1>
